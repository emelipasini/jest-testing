## Pascal Case

A function that converts the strings to pascalcase format, that is, each word begins with a capital letter and there are no separations between words.

The function has its corresponding tests that evaluate the most relevant cases such as an empty string, words separated by space or by dashes with or without capital letters.

To run only pascal case converter tests:

```bash
npm test tests/pascal-case.test.ts
```
